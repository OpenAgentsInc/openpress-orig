# OpenPress

OpenPress is a truly open source and extensible competitor to WordPress, built with Laravel. Our mission is to provide a modern, agent-centric alternative to traditional content management systems, emphasizing openness, extensibility, and performance.

## Why OpenPress?

- **Truly Open Source**: Unlike platforms controlled by a single person or company, OpenPress is committed to remaining genuinely open source, ensuring that the community drives its development and future.

- **Modern Technology Stack**: Built on Laravel, OpenPress leverages a powerful, modern PHP framework, providing a solid foundation for extensibility and performance.

- **Agent-Centric Approach**: Designed with a focus on integrating with AI agents and modern workflows, OpenPress aims to be at the forefront of the evolving digital landscape.

- **Lightweight and Performant**: We're building OpenPress from the ground up, avoiding the bloat and technical debt that plagues older systems. Our goal is to create a streamlined, efficient platform that doesn't rely on a "plugin-packed house of cards."

- **Easy Export and Portability**: Taking cues from modern platforms, we're committed to making it easy for users to export their content and code, ensuring that you're never locked into our ecosystem.

## Our Vision

OpenPress aims to harvest the best ideas from the WordPress ecosystem while avoiding its pitfalls. We're creating a platform that is:

1. Easy to use for content creators
2. Flexible for developers
3. Performant and lightweight
4. Truly open and community-driven
5. Forward-thinking in its approach to AI and automation
